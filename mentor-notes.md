## Notes for mentors

### Structure of Intro Workshop

This is a 1 hour and 45 minute workshop with quite a lot of reading material to cover. As it says in the readme, students should spend about 10 minutes reading each page and it will be followed by 10-15 minutes of questions and discussion. Note that the asynchronous section would benefit from going through the Loupe link on the projector.

There is a range of questions listed below - mentors should choose around 3 questions to ask each time.

The final part of this workshop is fixing an API request which should take 15-20 minutes.

### Questions

**Request & Response:**

* What do the req and res objects look like?
* How do you think you'd change the API url to look for a different gif?
* What is the request property responseText?
* What JSON method can we use to transform a responseText string into something we can use?

**HTTP:**

* Can you whiteboard the different sections of a url?
* What is HTTP?
* Can you name three HTTP methods?
* Can you think of an example of a POST request?

**XHR requests:**

* How do you create a new XHR object?
* What does each line in the request do?
* Why do we check on the onreadystatechange property?

**Asynchronicity:**

* What does synchronous and asynchronous mean?
* What's the benefit of asynchronous code?
* Can you explain what 'call stack' means?
